# J.K.S. aka Just Keep Scrolling

For my Unfamiliar Environment project through Galvanize I created an Instagram clone using Rails. It's my first time in both using the Rails framework and working with the Ruby language and I think it turned out pretty well, especially since we only had a week and half to get it done.

* Ruby version: 2.3.3

* Rails version: 5

* Please run "Bundle Install" to install the appropriate Gems and then rake db:migrate to create the database.
